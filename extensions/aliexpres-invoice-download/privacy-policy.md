### Privacy Policy for AliExpress Invoice Download extension

*Effective Date: April 26, 2025*

#### **Introduction**

This Privacy Policy describes how the AliExpress Invoice Download Extension ("we," "our," or "the Extension") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring your data remains secure while providing a seamless, business-grade invoice management experience for AliExpress users.

#### **Information Collection**

**What We Collect:**
- **Order IDs & Invoice IDs:** The extension scans your AliExpress order pages for visible order IDs and fetches invoice IDs from AliExpress servers.
- **Invoice PDFs:** For your convenience, official AliExpress invoice PDFs are downloaded and stored locally to enable instant access, offline use, and ZIP export.
- **Cache Data:** The extension caches order IDs, invoice IDs, order dates, and invoice PDFs in your browser for performance and offline access.

**How We Collect:**
- **Page Scanning:** When you click "Reload List" or open the extension, it scans the visible AliExpress orders page for order IDs.
- **API Requests:** The extension fetches invoice IDs and PDFs from AliExpress servers using only the order IDs found on your page.
- **Filtering/Search:** When you use the filter/search bar, filtering is performed locally-no additional data is sent anywhere.

#### **Use of Information**

Your data is used only to:
1. Generate and display invoice download links and PDFs for your AliExpress orders.
2. Enable advanced features such as bulk ZIP download, auto-prefetch, filtering, and grouping.
3. Cache previously processed orders and PDFs for fast, offline, and bulk access.
4. Ensure compliance for business, accounting, and tax purposes.

**We do not use your information for marketing, analytics, or profiling purposes.**

#### **Data Storage**

- **Local Only:** All order data and PDFs are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. No data is sent to our servers or any third party.
- **No External Transmission:** The extension never uploads your order or invoice data to any external server. All communication is between your browser and AliExpress.
- **Retention:** Cached data and PDFs remain until you clear them using "Clear Cache" in the extension settings.

#### **Data Sharing**

- **No Sharing:** We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your data with any third party.
- **AliExpress Only:** The only data transmission is between your browser and official AliExpress servers, as required to fetch invoice PDFs.

#### **Your Rights and Control**

- **View & Download:** You can view and download all invoices managed by the extension.
- **Delete:** You can clear all cached data and PDFs at any time via "Clear Cache."
- **Offline Use:** All invoices and PDFs remain accessible even when offline, until you clear the cache.

#### **Security**

- **Local-Only Storage:** All data is stored on your device.
- **Minimal Permissions:** The extension only requests permissions needed for its single purpose (see Chrome Web Store listing for details).
- **No Sensitive Data:** No personal, financial, or authentication data is collected or stored.
- **Official Domains Only:** The extension only communicates with official AliExpress domains.

#### **Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy. Updates will be posted on the Chrome Web Store listing and reflected in the "Effective Date" above. Please review periodically for any changes.
