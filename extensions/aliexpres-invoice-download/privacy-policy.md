# Privacy Policy for AliExpress Invoice Download Extension

*Effective Date: April 16, 2025*

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the AliExpress Invoice Download Extension ("we," "our," or "the Extension") handles and protects your information when you use our Chrome browser extension. We are committed to ensuring the privacy and security of your data while providing you with a seamless invoice downloading experience.

## Information Collection

### What Information We Collect

The AliExpress Invoice Download Extension collects only the following limited information:

- **Order IDs**: The Extension scans AliExpress order pages to identify order ID numbers that are already visible to you on the page.
- **Invoice IDs**: The Extension retrieves invoice IDs from AliExpress servers that correspond to your order IDs.
- **Cache Data**: For performance optimization, the Extension temporarily stores previously processed order IDs and their corresponding invoice IDs in your browser's local storage.

### How Information Is Collected

- **Page Scanning**: When you click the "Generate Invoice Links" button or when the Extension runs automatically on an AliExpress orders page, it scans the current page for order IDs.
- **API Requests**: The Extension makes requests to AliExpress servers to fetch invoice IDs using the order IDs found on the page.
- **Manual Input**: When you manually enter an order ID in the Extension's interface, this information is processed to retrieve the corresponding invoice ID.

## Use of Information

The information collected is used solely for the following purposes:

1. To generate invoice download links for your AliExpress orders
2. To display a list of your orders and their corresponding invoice links within the Extension interface
3. To cache previously processed orders to improve performance and avoid redundant API calls

We do not use your information for any other purposes, including but not limited to marketing, analytics, or user profiling.

## Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: All order IDs and invoice IDs are stored locally on your device using browser local storage and Chrome's storage API. This information never leaves your browser except when making necessary API calls to AliExpress servers.
- **No External Servers**: The Extension does not maintain any external servers and does not transmit your data to our own servers.
- **Retention Period**: Cached data remains in your browser's local storage until you explicitly clear it using the "Clear Cache" button in the Extension's settings.

## Data Sharing

The AliExpress Invoice Download Extension does not share, sell, rent, or trade any information with third parties. The only data transmission that occurs is between your browser and AliExpress servers when fetching invoice IDs, which is necessary for the core functionality of the Extension.

## Your Rights and Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **View Stored Data**: You can view all stored order and invoice IDs in the Extension's interface.
- **Delete Data**: You can clear all cached data at any time by using the "Clear Cache" button in the Settings tab.
- **Manual Mode**: You can choose to use only the manual input feature without allowing the Extension to automatically scan pages.

## Security

We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your information:

- All data is stored locally on your device
- The Extension only requests the minimum permissions necessary for its functionality
- No sensitive authentication information is collected or stored
- The Extension only communicates with official AliExpress domains

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Chrome Web Store listing and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
